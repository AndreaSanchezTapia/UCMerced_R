Welcome! This website has the materials for the R Curriculum taught at UC Merced in the Fall of 2020. This was an 8-hr training divided in four sessions: 

1. [Introduction to R and RStudio](slides/01_Introduction_to_R.html)
2. [Starting with data](slides/02_Starting_with_data.html)
2. [Plots and Exploratory Data Analysis](slides/03_Plot_and_EDA_in_R.html)
2. [Manipulating data with __dplyr__](slides/04_Manipulating.html)

These lessons are based on the [Carpentries Ecology curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop)

An example GitHub repository to follow the lessons is available here: https://github.com/AndreaSanchezTapia/UCM_R. It has a very generic structure:


```bash
.
├── UCM_R.Rproj
├── README.md
├── 01_script.R
├── 02_... and other scripts 
└── data
    ├── processed
    └── raw
```
    
You can download the .zip file by clicking the green button (Code) and selecting the last option, "download.zip". To open the project and get to work, click twice on `UCM_R.Rproj`.
