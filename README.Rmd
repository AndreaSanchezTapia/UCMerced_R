# Before starting...
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# overview of R and RStudio


## why learn `R`?

+ **_libre_ software**: free and free-to-be-used-and-modified for any means -> one of the pillars of open science
+ __script-based__: reproducibility, easy to scale up your analyses, transparency (track errors), great way to learn about methods.
+ __interdisciplinary and modular__: lots of code written by area specialists. At the core of its philosophy is a smooth transition from user to programmer.
+ __communication__ with other tools: manuscripts, presentations, apps and dashboards

## why learn `R`?

+ communication with __other programming languages__ (ex. __reticulate__ to run python scripts) 
+ great __graphic capabilities__!
+ __official support__: help in documentation, mailing lists
+ __an active and welcoming community__:  email lists, Stack Overflow, [RStudio community](community.rstudio.com/), useR groups, __R-Ladies+__ chapters, Slack communities, `r icon::fa("twitter")` `#rstats`


## `R` has a modular structure: __packages__


+ `R` __base__ installation includes base packages developed and maintained by the __`R` Core Development Team__
+ other packages are created by the community
+ hosted in __CRAN__ (The Comprehensive `R` Archive Network) or Bioconductor, GitHub, rOpenSci.org
+ a package is a collection of functions, it must be loaded to be used (ex. `library(dplyr)`)
+ the whole package is loaded, not some functions or parts of it. if you want to use one function you can use `package::function()`

## how to run R

+ from the R program in Windows ~~but don't~~
+ directly in the __terminal__ in Linux and Mac (just type `R`). this is important in __HPC__ environments like the UC Merced cluster (R scripts can also be run from outside R)
+ many GUIs and text editors: rgedit, __emacs ESS__, Atom, Sublime Text etc.
+ __RStudio__: an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - Desktop Version but also Server and Cloud versions

## install, load, and cite packages


```{r, eval =F}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyverse") # just an umbrella package
```

+ to install dependencies: `install.packages(xxx, dependencies = TRUE)`
+ if you get an error about a missing __dependency__ copy the name of the missing package(s) and execute `install.packages()`

```{r, paged.print=TRUE}
library("dplyr")
citation("dplyr")
toBibtex(citation("dplyr"))
```

## about notation

+ __packages__ are collections of __functions__
+ __functions__ have __arguments__ or __parameters__ (options) 

To designate them:

+ package name: __base__ (in __bold__ letters)
+ function name: `help()` (in fixed width font and with parentheses at the end)
+ objects and arguments: `data`, `na.rm` (in fixed width font)
+ sometimes you'll see `stats::median()` this is correct syntaxis `program::function()` and helps distinguish __functions with the same name__ or calling one function only (from an __installed__ package)

Check for the following panes: 

+ Environment -> Objects in the __workspace__
+ Files
+ Plots
+ Help
+ Console

Some other that might be useful _later_: 

  + __Terminal__
  + __Viewer__ (for presentations and documents)
  + __git__ (only when working inside an RStudio project)

## working directory

+ the __files__ pane is showing one folder location:

  + `Home/Documents`
  + `~/Documents`
  + `"/Users/andreasancheztapia/Documents"`


+ in `Global options > General > R Sessions` OR `cmd` + `,`
"default working directory when not in a project"


+ `getwd()` in the console


+ we have to tell R where we are working -> change the working directory

## project organization

+ projects are better organized if we use __one folder per project__ and  __subfolders__ within our working directory
+ take care of data __provenance__: we shouldn't modify __raw data files__ but __save processed data__ (and the corresponding scripts) 

In practice:

```
project/
*    ├── data/
*    ├── raw_data/
     ├── docs/
*    ├── figs/
     ├── R/
     ├── output/
     └── README.md
```


## Hands on: 

1. Select our folder for this project
2. Create a subfolder structure: `/figs`, `/data_raw`, `/data`

## RStudio projects 

RStudio projects create a .Rproj file in your folder that acts as a shortcut for your projects

+ recognize the location
+ respect some project-specific preferences
+ reopen files
+ __git__ pane available

## about the workspace

+ R creates __objects__ that occupy RAM memory: the __workspace__
+ the __workspace__ can be saved and loaded between sessions BUT
+ __you can lose track of how you created the objects in the workspace__
+ `#goodpractices` don't save the workspace

"figs/0b_soft_wrap.png"


__soft wrap__ your scripts so you don't have to scroll side to side

__soft wrap__ your scripts so you don't </br> have to scroll side to side

"figs/0d_terminal.png"

check your terminal

+ we have an __RStudio project__ in the correct __working directory__, with a nice file structure and RStudio is configured
+ how did package installation go?

## introduction to R 

+ `<-` is the assignment operation in R and it does not return output
+ overwriting objects __does not affect other objects__ 
+  __naming things__: don't begin with a number or symbol. be consistent with your __coding style__! 
+ separators can be anything and (you could use `.` but be nice).

 <!-- + `r icon::fa("python")` R doesn't care about indentation --> 


## data types in R

```{r datatypes}
animals  <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
```


```{r remedy003}
class(animals)
```


```{r class}
class(weight_g)
```


`character` and `numeric` but also `logical` and `integer` ("whole" numbers, with no decimal component, in $N$), `complex`, and others. 


## subsetting vectors

+ R is __1-indexed__ and intervals are closed (not half-open)

```{r, results = 'show'}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
```

+ Subsetting is done with brackets `[]`

```{r subset}
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

## conditional subsetting

```{r, results = 'show'}
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

Nobody works like this, instead we use __logical clauses__ to __generate__ these logical vectors

## logical clauses

+ equality or not: `==`, `!=`
+ inequalities: `<`. `>`, `<=`, `>=`
+ union (OR) `|`
+ intersection (AND) `&`
+ belonging `%in%`
+ differences between sets: `setdiff()`
+ negation works `!`: "not in" `!a %in% b`

## comparing vectors

```{r recycling}

animals      <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
more_animals <- c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")

animals %in% more_animals
```

---
##comparing vectors

```{r recycling2}
animals      <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
more_animals <- c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")

animals == more_animals
```

+ Vectors are compared __one by one AND recycled__ when one of them is shorter, so use `%in%` when you want to check __belonging to a set__

## missing data

```{r na}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## data structures

+ __vector__: lineal arrays (one dimension: only length)
+ __factors__: vectors (one-dimensional) representing __categorical variables__ and thus having __levels__
+ __matrices__: arrays of vectors -> the same type (all numeric or all character, for instance) (two dimensions: width and length)
+ __data frames__: two-dimensional arrays but might be of combined types (i.e., column 1 with names, column 2 with numbers)
+ __arrays__ are similar to matrices and dataframes but may be three-dimensional ("layered" data frames)
+ __list__: literally a list of anything (a list of data frames, or different objects)
