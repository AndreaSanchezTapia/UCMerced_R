+ we setup a project and its file structure

+ we started using R inside RStudio

+ we created numerical, character and logical vectors with `c()` 

+ we learned to subset vectors with brackets `[]` and other functions: `length()`, `:`, `seq(from, to, interval)`

+ vector subset can be done via numeric or logical indexes

---
## data structures in R

+ __vector__: lineal arrays (one dimension: only length)
--

+ __matrices__: arrays of vectors of the same type (all numeric or all character, for instance) (two dimensions: width and length)
--

+ __data frames__: two-dimensional structures ("rectangular") but might be of combined types (i.e., column 1 with names, column 2 with numbers)
--

+ __factors__: vectors (one-dimensional) representing __categorical variables__ and thus having __levels__
--

+ __lists__: literally lists, of objects that can be of any type (a list of data frames, or different objects)
--

+ __arrays__ are similar to matrices and dataframes but may be three-dimensional ("layered" data frames)




---
## matrices

+ data have to be of the same type

```{r}
?matrix
matrix(nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
```

---
## matrices

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nums <- 1:12
matrix(data = nums, nrow = 3)
matrix(data = nums, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m <- matrix(data = nums, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE, 
       dimnames = list(c(LETTERS[1:3]), letters[1:4]))
m
```

+ matrix algebra 

---
class: inverse, middle, center
## starting with data

---
## the survey dataset

+ Data frames: one row per sampling unit (individual), one column per variable

```{r columns}
knitr::include_graphics("./docs/figs/columns.png")
```


---
## downloading the dataset

We are going to download the file to our `data/raw` sub folder:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
if (!file.exists("data/raw")) dir.create("data/raw")
if (!file.exists("data/raw/portal_data_joined.csv")) {
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
}
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

---
## reading files into R

Functions to read data are key to any project.
for data frames: `read.csv()`, `read.delim()`


```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data/raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
surveys_check <- read.table(file = "data/raw/portal_data_joined.csv",
                            sep = ",",
                            header = TRUE)
identical(surveys, surveys_check)
```

---
## reading files into R

+ Package __readr__ 
+ Package __data.table__ (`data.table::fread()`) when you need to open a large file
+ Excel spreadsheets: `readxl::read_excel()`
+ __Graphic interface__

There are __many other ways__ to read data into R, some are specific for the type of data (GIS shapefiles or raster, and specific packages may come with their own reader functions)

---
## basic functions to explore dataframes

```{r try, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
str(surveys)
dim(surveys)
nrow(surveys)
ncol(surveys)
head(surveys) # 6 rows by default
head(surveys)[,1:3]
tail(surveys)
names(surveys)
rownames(surveys)
length(surveys) # number of columns
summary(surveys)
```

---
## inspecting `data.frame` objects

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

+ What is the class of the object surveys?

+ How many rows and how many columns are in this object?

+ What is the type of data of the columns?


---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

+ a vector has only one dimension, so:

  + `length()` refers to number of __elements__
  + `dim()`
  + selection between brackets `[]`

--

+ a data.frame has __two__ dimensions, so `dim()`, `ncol()`, `nrow()` selection between brackets `[]` __BUT with the two dimensions separated by a comma__: `[rows, columns]`

---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(surveys)
surveys[, 6]
surveys[1, ]
surveys[ , 13]
surveys[4, 13]

```

---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

<small>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
sub <- surveys[1:10,]
# first element in the first column of the data frame

# first element in the 6th column

# first column of the data frame

# first three elements in the 7th column

# the 3rd row of the data frame


```

---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

<small>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame
sub[1, 1]
# first element in the 6th column
sub[1, 6]
# first column of the data frame
sub[, 1]
# first column of the data frame
sub[1]
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
sub[1:3, 7]
# the 3rd row of the data frame
sub[3, ]
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ]

```


---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

+ minus sign to __remove__ the indexed column or row

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[, -1]
surveys[-(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

---
## selecting columns by name

```{r subset, eval = FALSE}
  surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
* surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
  surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
* surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```

+ R has several ways to do some things

---
## challenge

<small>

+ Create a data.frame (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in row 200 of the `surveys` dataset

--

+ Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a data.frame? Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame

--

+ Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations

--

+ Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.

--

+ Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

--

+ Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

--

+ Combine `nrow()` with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

</small>

```{r challenge2, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Create a data.frame (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in row 200 of the `surveys` dataset

# Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a data.frame? Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame

# Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations

# Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.

# Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

# Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

# Combine `nrow()` with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

```

## some basic plotting 

.pull.left[
```{r}
x <- surveys$weight
y <- surveys$hindfoot_length
plot(x, y)
```
]

---
## plotting a single variable

```{r, eval = T}
plot(surveys$hindfoot_length)
plot(sort(surveys$hindfoot_length))

```

---
## factors

+ __factors__: vectors (one-dimensional) representing __categorical variables__ and thus having __levels__. ordered (`c(“low”, “medium”, “high”)` or unordered (`c("green", "blue", "red")`)

+ R < 4.0 had a default behavior `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` so any character column was transformed into a factor

```r
`?read.csv()`
?default.stringsAsFactors
```

#### today if we want factors we have to transform the vectors

---
## factors

<small>
```{r eval = FALSE, echo= TRUE}
## Compare the difference between our data read as
#`factor` vs `character`.
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv",
                    stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv",
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)
```

---
## factors

Convert the column "plot_type" and "sex" into a factor:

```{r}
surveys$plot_type <- factor(surveys$plot_type)
surveys$sex <- factor(surveys$sex)

```


---

```{r}
head(surveys$plot_type)
levels(surveys$plot_type)
plot(surveys$weight ~ surveys$plot_type)
```

+ check the __tilde__ `~` notation, formula:
"as a function of"

`plot(a ~ b)`
`plot(b, a)`

---
## working with factors

<small>
```{r remedy001, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
levels(sex) # in alphabetical order!
nlevels(sex)
sex
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex # after re-ordering
as.character(sex)

year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(year_fct)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]    # The recommended way.
```

---
## let's make a plot of a factor variable

`plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))`

.pull-right[let's rename this label]

```{r plot, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))
#take the variable out
sex <- factor(surveys$sex)
#head(sex, n = 6)
#levels(sex)
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
#levels(sex)
#head(sex) # hasta aquí con ellos
```

---
## let's make a plot of a factor variable

`plot(sex)`

.pull-right[let's rename this label]

```{r plot2, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
plot(sex)
```


---
## challenge

<small>

.pull-left[
```{r remedy003, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
levels(sex)[2] <- "female"
levels(sex)[3] <- "male"
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "undetermined"))
plot(as.factor(sex))
```
]

.pull-right[

+ Rename “F” and “M” to “female” and “male” respectively.

+ Now that we have renamed the factor level to “undetermined”, can you recreate the barplot such that “undetermined” is last (after “male”)?
]


---
## working with several tables

+ in real analysis settings you will have many tables that are related

--

+ in ecology for example:

--

  - sites x species

--

  - sites x environmental conditions

--

  - species x characteristics

--

  - individuals x individual measurement
