This was an 8-hr training divided in four sessions:\nIntroduction to R and RStudio\nStarting with data\nPlots and Exploratory Data Analysis\nManipulating data with dplyr\nThese lessons are based on the Carpentries Ecology curriculum\nAn example GitHub repository to follow the lessons is available here: https://github.com/AndreaSanchezTapia/UCM_R. It has a very generic structure:\n.\n├── UCM_R.Rproj\n├── README.md\n├── 01_script.R\n├── 02_... and other scripts \n└── data\n    ├── processed\n    └── raw\nYou can download the .zip file by clicking the green button (Code) and selecting the last option, “download.zip”. To open the project and get to work, click twice on UCM_R.Rproj.\n\n\n\n",
