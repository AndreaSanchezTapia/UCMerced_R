# overview of R and RStudio

---

## why learn `R`?

+ the language of choice for academic statisticians

--

+ **_libre_ software**: free and free-to-be-used-and-modified for any means -> one of the pillars of open science

--

+ __script-based__: reproducibility, easier to scale up your analyses, transparency (track errors), great way to learn about methods.

--

+ __interdisciplinary and modular__: lots of code written by area specialists. At the core of its philosophy is a smooth transition from user to programmer.

--

+ __communication__ with other tools: manuscripts, presentations, apps and dashboards


---
## why learn `R`?

+ communication with __other programming languages__ (ex. __reticulate__ to run python scripts) 

--

+ great __graphic capabilities__!

--


+ __official support__: help in documentation, mailing lists

--

+ __an active and welcoming community__:  email lists, Stack Overflow, [RStudio community](community.rstudio.com/), useR groups, .purple[R-Ladies+] chapters, Slack communities, `r icon::fa("twitter")` `#rstats`

<center>
```{r remedy001, out.width=150, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/blob/master/stickers/rainbow-inclusive.png")
```

---
## `R` has a modular structure: __packages__


+ `R` __base__ installation includes base packages developed and maintained by the __`R` Core Development Team__

--

+ other packages are created by the community and hosted in __CRAN__ (The Comprehensive `R` Archive Network) or Bioconductor, GitHub, rOpenSci.org

--

+ to install packages from CRAN: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

# Setup and project organization

---
## working directory

+ you have to tell R where you will be working, so that it understands where to read tables, where to save outputs etc: __working directory__

--

+ `getwd()` in the console

--

+ the default is __"home"__: check general options and the "File" tab

--

+ you can tell R and RStudio where you want to work with `setwd()`

--

+ even better: instead of opening RStudio open an __R script__ or a __RStudio project__ (just as you would in MS Word   `r icon::fa("file-word")`)

---
## project organization and best practices

+ projects are better organized if we use __one folder per project__ and  __subfolders__ within our working directory

--

+ we shouldn't modify __raw data files__ but __save processed data__ (and the corresponding scripts)

--

+ instead of __absolute paths__ we should use __relative paths__:
  + `.` "here"
  + `./figs` a subfolder called `figs`
  + the upper level `..`
  
--

+ avoid `C:users/your_name/your_file_structure/your_working_directory`

---
## In this and the following sessions


```
project/
*    ├── data/
*    │   ├── raw
*    │   └── processed
     ├── docs/
*    ├── figs/
     ├── R/
*    ├── output/
*    └── README.md
```

+ unzip the .zip file into a folder of your preference

<right>
`r icon::fa("laptop-code", size = 3)`
</right>

---
## RStudio projects 

RStudio projects create a __.Rproj__ file in your folder that acts as a shortcut for your projects

# introduction to R 

---
## introduction to R 

+ `<-` is the assignment operation in R and it does not return output it __creates objects__ that are saved in the workspace
(`Alt + -`)

--

+ overwriting objects __does not affect other objects__ 

--

+  __naming object tips__: 
 + don't begin with a number or symbol.
 + there are forbidden words 
 + be consistent with your __coding style__! 
 + avoid dots
 + __name functions as verbs and objects as nouns__

--

+ you can see which objects are saved in the workspace by using `ls()`

---

## about the workspace

+ R creates __objects__ that occupy RAM memory: the __workspace__

--

+ the __workspace__ can be saved and loaded between sessions BUT

--

+ __you can lose track of how you created the objects in the workspace__

--

+ `#goodpractices` don't save the workspace

# functions, arguments and understanding the  help

---
## functions and arguments

```
weight_kg <- sqrt(10)

round(3.14159)

args(round)
```

---
## if you know the name of the function
```
help(function)
?function
args(function)
```

+ select the name of the function and click __F1__

Check the structure of the help file:

+ Description
+ Usage
+ Arguments
+ Details

---
## if you don't know the name of the function

```
??kruskal
```

(or search it - google it - duckduckgo it)

---
## the structure of a function help

`args(function)`

+ The arguments of a function are coded:
  + in order
  + with or without default settings
  
--

You can either
+ use the arguments in order, without naming them
+ use the first arguments without naming them and then some optional arguments, with name


---
## data types in R

<small>
```{r datatypes}
animals  <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
```

--

```{r remedy003}
class(animals)
```

--

```{r class}
class(weight_g)
```
</small>

--

`character` and `numeric` but also `logical` and `integer` ("whole" numbers, with no decimal component, in $N$), `complex`, and others. 

---
class: center, middle

`r icon::fa("laptop-code", size = 3)`

---
## subsetting vectors

+ R is __1-indexed__ and intervals are closed (not half-open)

```{r, results = 'show'}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
```

+ Subsetting is done with brackets `[]`

```{r subset}
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

---
## conditional subsetting

```{r, results = 'show'}
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

Nobody works like this, instead we use __logical clauses__ to __generate__ these logical vectors

---


## logical clauses

+ equality or not: `==`, `!=`
+ inequalities: `<`. `>`, `<=`, `>=`
+ union (OR) `|`
+ intersection (AND) `&`
+ belonging `%in%`
+ differences between sets: `setdiff()`
+ negation works `!`: "not in" `!a %in% b`

---
## comparing vectors

<small>
```{r recycling}

animals      <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
more_animals <- c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")

animals %in% more_animals
```

---
##comparing vectors

<small>
```{r recycling2}
animals      <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
more_animals <- c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")

animals == more_animals
```

+ Vectors are compared __one by one AND recycled__ when one of them is shorter, so use `%in%` when you want to check __belonging to a set__

---
## missing data

<small>
```{r na}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

## data structures

+ __vector__: lineal arrays (one dimension: only length)

--

+ __factors__: vectors (one-dimensional) representing __categorical variables__ and thus having __levels__

--

+ __matrices__: arrays of vectors -> the same type (all numeric or all character, for instance) (two dimensions: width and length)

--

+ __data frames__: two-dimensional arrays but might be of combined types (i.e., column 1 with names, column 2 with numbers)

--

+ __arrays__ are similar to matrices and dataframes but may be three-dimensional ("layered" data frames)

--

+ __list__: literally a list of anything (a list of data frames, or different objects)
