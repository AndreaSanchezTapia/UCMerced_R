I am a Colombian biologist (she/her) living in Merced, CA. I use R since 2009 and I am part of [RLadies+](https://rladies.org/) and of the [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/) Organizing Team. My main interests are Biodiversity Informatics, Open and Responsible Data Science, and Community Ecology.
